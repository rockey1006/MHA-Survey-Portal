# Technical Handoff

Generated: 2026-05-07

This document summarizes the current operating state of the MHA Survey Portal for the next technical lead, maintainer, or production administrator. It is based on the repository code, local documentation, and deployment/configuration files currently present in the project.

## Current App Status

### Live / production-ready workflows

- Role-aware authentication and dashboards for `student`, `advisor`, and `admin` users are implemented with Devise and Google OAuth.
- Google sign-in is restricted to TAMU email domains: `@tamu.edu` and `@email.tamu.edu`.
- Student workflows include profile completion gating, survey assignment visibility, progress saving, submission, response viewing, print/PDF-oriented views, and portfolio export.
- Advisor workflows include advisee dashboards, survey assignment review, student detail pages, feedback, and read-only admin impersonation support.
- Admin workflows include:
  - People Management for user role changes, member removal, advisor assignments, student track updates, and assignment group changes.
  - Program Configuration for tracks, majors, cohorts, semesters, and competency target levels.
  - Survey Builder for surveys, sections, questions, legends, previews, archive/activate flows, and audit/change history.
  - Grade Import Batches for mapping workbooks and direct competency CSV/XLSX/XLSM imports.
  - Competencies matrix comparing self, advisor, and course-derived ratings.
  - Student Records with semester-oriented progress review and exports.
  - Reports with filters, charts, PDF exports, and Excel exports.
  - Maintenance mode management.
- Course-derived competency ratings are intentionally separate from advisor feedback. They are stored through grade import evidence/rating models rather than overwriting survey or feedback data.
- Grade imports support dry runs, commit, rollback, recommit, duplicate suppression, row-level errors, pending unmatched student rows, and derived competency ratings.
- Notifications and assignment automation exist through Active Job jobs such as `SurveyNotificationJob` and `ReconcileSurveyAssignmentsJob`.
- Local development is well-supported through Docker Compose and a local Ruby setup path.
- CI is configured in GitHub Actions for Brakeman, importmap audit, RuboCop, Minitest, and system tests.

### Pending / incomplete operational work

- Add dedicated smoke tests for the highest-risk grade import paths:
  - mapping workbook import
  - direct competency import
  - duplicate suppression
  - pending-row reconciliation
  - dry run commit
  - rollback
- Add clearer operator guidance on the Grade Import Batch results page, especially for direct competency detection, pending versus failed rows, duplicate suppression, and course-rating semester scope.
- Split `GradeImports::BatchProcessor` into smaller parser/router/validator services. It currently owns too much behavior and is the main maintainability risk.
- Add more representative import sample files:
  - successful direct competency import
  - duplicate upload example
  - pending-row example
  - intentionally invalid mapping example
- Add true semester support to course-derived ratings. The UI can filter self/advisor data by semester, but imported course ratings are not semester-scoped at the storage layer.
- Improve admin competencies usability with remembered filters, export of filtered matrices, or quick-jump/sticky context.
- Keep repo docs and GitHub wiki docs synchronized. The README treats the wiki as the broader knowledge base.

### Known bugs / risks

- Direct competency imports require a real `Student SIS ID` or `Student ID`; blank identifiers cannot be matched or staged correctly.
- Course ratings shown in `Admin > Competencies` are latest reportable imported values, not truly semester-filtered values.
- Production currently sets `config.active_job.queue_adapter = :inline` in `config/environments/production.rb`. This avoids a separate queue dependency but means background jobs run synchronously in request flow.
- `config/recurring.yml` defines a Solid Queue hourly cleanup task, but production is not currently wired to run Solid Queue as the Active Job adapter. Treat recurring Solid Queue behavior as inactive unless production queue configuration is restored.
- `Procfile` only defines `release` and `web`; there is no Heroku worker process.
- `config.action_mailer.default_url_options` still uses `example.com`, and SMTP settings are commented out. Email delivery should be considered unconfigured until production SMTP and host settings are set.
- `config.active_storage.service = :local` in production. On Heroku this is not persistent across dyno restarts, so uploads should be moved to S3/GCS/Azure or another durable service before relying on long-term uploaded file retention.
- `config/deploy.yml` is still a Kamal template with placeholder values such as `your-user`, `192.168.0.1`, and `app.example.com`. Do not treat it as production-ready without replacing those values.
- Development Google OAuth credentials are hard-coded in `config/environments/development.rb`. Rotate them if they are real credentials, and prefer local credentials or environment variables going forward.
- Seeded development data is useful but not representative enough for all import behavior. Import validation is most reliable against a sanitized production-like database clone.
- Repository cleanup before handoff removed redirect-only dashboard templates, a duplicate static PDF layout, dated generated import sample outputs, local generated artifacts, and the tracked `config/master.key`. Transfer the Rails master key separately through a secure channel.

## Deployment Workflow

### Current supported paths

The repository contains three deployment-related paths:

- Heroku: most explicit production/review-app workflow through `Procfile` and `app.json`.
- Docker: production image via `Dockerfile`; local stack via `docker-compose.yml`.
- Kamal: scaffolded in `config/deploy.yml`, but still placeholder-based and not production-ready as-is.

### Pre-deploy checklist

1. Confirm the target branch is green in GitHub Actions:
   - Brakeman security scan
   - importmap JavaScript dependency audit
   - RuboCop
   - Rails tests and system tests
2. Confirm secrets are available:
   - `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, provided out-of-band by a maintainer
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - production database credentials or `DATABASE_URL`
3. Confirm Google OAuth redirect URI matches the production domain.
4. Confirm `ENABLE_ROLE_SWITCH` is unset or disabled in production unless a temporary QA session explicitly requires it.
5. Confirm any expected maintenance window with program stakeholders.
6. Back up the production database before migrations that touch survey responses, grade imports, users, or competency ratings.

### Heroku deployment

The Heroku path is the clearest current deployment workflow.

1. Install and authenticate the Heroku CLI.
2. Confirm the production app has required add-ons:
   - Heroku Postgres
   - a wkhtmltopdf-compatible buildpack or binary path for PDF generation
3. Configure buildpacks in this order:
   - `https://github.com/dscout/wkhtmltopdf-buildpack`
   - `heroku/ruby`
4. Set required config vars:

   ```bash
   heroku config:set RAILS_ENV=production
   heroku config:set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<master-key>
   heroku config:set GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<google-client-id>
   heroku config:set GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<google-client-secret>
   heroku config:set APP_TIME_ZONE="Central Time (US & Canada)"
   ```

5. Verify Heroku provides `DATABASE_URL`.
6. Deploy from the release branch:

   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

7. Let the Heroku `release` process run:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails db:migrate
   ```

8. Verify the app boots:

   ```bash
   heroku ps
   heroku logs --tail
   ```

9. Visit `/up` on the production domain and confirm a healthy response.
10. Sign in with a TAMU admin account and smoke-test:
    - Admin dashboard
    - People Management
    - Survey Builder index
    - Grade Import Batches index
    - Competencies index
    - Reports page
11. For review apps, `app.json` runs:

    ```bash
    bundle exec rails db:prepare db:seed
    ```

    Review apps require `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`.

### Docker deployment

The production `Dockerfile` builds a Rails image with Ruby 3.4.6, PostgreSQL client libraries, Thruster, and wkhtmltopdf support.

1. Build the image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t health_app .
   ```

2. Run with required environment variables:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 \
     -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<master-key> \
     -e DATABASE_URL=<postgres-url> \
     -e GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<google-client-id> \
     -e GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<google-client-secret> \
     --name health_app health_app
   ```

3. Confirm the container boots and `/up` responds.
4. Confirm persistent storage. The image uses local Active Storage by default, so a production Docker deployment needs either:
   - a mounted persistent volume for `/rails/storage`, or
   - a move to cloud object storage.

### Kamal deployment

Kamal is present but not configured for real production.

Before using Kamal:

1. Replace `service`, `image`, `servers`, `proxy.host`, and `registry.username` in `config/deploy.yml`.
2. Add secrets to `.kamal/secrets`, especially:
   - `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`
   - `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
   - database credentials if not using an external `DATABASE_URL`
3. Decide whether Solid Queue should run inside Puma with `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true` or as a separate job host.
4. Configure a durable database and durable Active Storage.
5. Run:

   ```bash
   bin/kamal setup
   bin/kamal deploy
   ```

Treat this path as future-ready scaffolding, not the current recommended production path.

### Rollback

For Heroku:

1. Identify the prior release:

   ```bash
   heroku releases
   ```

2. Roll back:

   ```bash
   heroku rollback v<N>
   ```

3. If migrations were destructive or incompatible, restore from a database backup rather than relying only on app rollback.
4. Re-run smoke tests after rollback.

For grade import data issues:

- Prefer the built-in batch rollback/recommit workflow when the problem is isolated to one import batch.
- Do not manually delete import evidence/rating rows in production unless you have confirmed the batch relationships and backed up the database.

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Scheduled tasks

- `config/recurring.yml` defines one production recurring task:

  ```ruby
  SolidQueue::Job.clear_finished_in_batches(sleep_between_batches: 0.3)
  ```

  Schedule: every hour at minute 12.

- Important caveat: production currently uses the inline Active Job adapter, so Solid Queue recurring tasks will not run unless Solid Queue is re-enabled and a worker/supervisor is running.

### Routine checks

- Review GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.
- Run a manual admin smoke test after changes touching:
  - survey assignment
  - survey submission
  - advisor feedback
  - grade imports
  - competencies matrix
  - reports/export code
  - user roles
- Check logs for:
  - OAuth failures
  - CSRF resets
  - pending grade import reconciliation failures
  - PDF/wkhtmltopdf failures
  - slow grade import requests if jobs remain inline
- Verify `/up` health checks after each deploy.
- Keep `db/schema.rb`, `db/cache_schema.rb`, `db/queue_schema.rb`, and `db/cable_schema.rb` in sync after migrations.

### API key / secret rotation

Rotate on maintainer handoff, suspected exposure, or at least once per academic year:

- Google OAuth client secret in Google Cloud Console.
- `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` only with a planned credentials rotation, because all encrypted credentials depend on it.
- Heroku account access and Heroku API tokens.
- Heroku Postgres credentials if exposed.
- Container registry token if using Kamal/Docker registry deploys.
- Any future SMTP, S3/GCS/Azure, or monitoring service credentials.

After rotating Google OAuth credentials:

1. Update production config vars.
2. Update allowed redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console.
3. Test sign-in for all three roles.
4. Remove old OAuth clients/secrets.

### Known technical debt

- `GradeImports::BatchProcessor` should be decomposed.
- Course-derived ratings need first-class semester/term storage.
- Production background jobs need a deliberate decision: keep inline for simplicity or restore Solid Queue with worker capacity.
- Production Active Storage needs durable object storage or explicit persistent volume management.
- Mailer host and SMTP settings need production values before depending on email delivery.
- Development OAuth credentials should be removed from committed config and moved to environment/local credentials.
- Admin UI remains the densest surface and needs continued smoke coverage.
- Documentation is split between repo docs and the GitHub wiki; keep both updated when workflows change.

## Dependencies

- Docker registry and host infrastructure if using Docker/Kamal.
- Optional future durable object storage for Active Storage uploads.
- Optional future SMTP service for email delivery.

## Admin Access

### How admin privileges work

- `User` is the authenticated account model.
- `User.role` is an enum string: `student`, `advisor`, or `admin`.
- Admin users automatically get an `Admin` profile through `User#ensure_role_profile!`.
- Admin-only controllers under `Admin::` inherit from `Admin::BaseController`, which requires `current_user.role_admin?`.
- Admin role management is available through `People Management`, but the UI blocks changing your own role.
- Admin activity for role and member changes is recorded through `AdminActivityLog` where implemented.

### Creating or transferring admin access

Preferred path:

1. Have the incoming owner sign in once with their TAMU Google account.
2. An existing admin opens `People Management > Members`.
3. Search for the incoming owner's account.
4. Change their role to `admin`.
5. Confirm they can access:
   - `/admin_dashboard`
   - `People Management`
   - `Admin > Program Configuration`
   - `Admin > Grade Import Batches`
6. Keep at least two active admin users before removing or demoting the outgoing owner.

Console fallback:

```ruby
user = User.find_by!(email: "new.owner@tamu.edu")
user.update!(role: "admin")
user.send(:ensure_role_profile!)
```

Use the console fallback only when no current admin can reach People Management.

### Removing or reducing admin access

1. Confirm another active admin can sign in successfully.
2. In `People Management > Members`, change the outgoing user's role to `advisor` or `student`, or remove the member if the account should no longer exist.
3. Do not remove your own account from the UI; the controller blocks self-removal and self-role changes.
4. Rotate shared deployment credentials if the outgoing admin had access to Heroku, GitHub, Google Cloud, production database backups, or Rails credentials.

### Non-app administrative access to transfer

The app role is only one part of operational ownership. Also transfer:

- GitHub repository admin/maintainer access.
- Heroku app and pipeline access.
- Heroku Postgres access and backup permissions.
- Google Cloud OAuth client ownership.
- Domain/DNS ownership for the production host.
- Rails master key storage ownership.
- Any Docker registry/Kamal server access if that path is adopted.
- Wiki/documentation ownership.

### Admin smoke test after transfer

After granting admin access, the incoming owner should verify:

1. Google OAuth sign-in succeeds with a TAMU email.
2. Admin dashboard loads.
3. People Management loads and role counts look sane.
4. Program Configuration loads.
5. Survey Builder index loads.
6. Grade Import Batches index loads.
7. Competencies matrix loads.
8. Reports page loads.
9. Maintenance mode page is accessible.
