# Intentionally empty.
#
# Rails validates foreign keys after fixture loading.
# If a table has FK constraints but no fixture file, old rows can remain
# across runs (especially when reusing the test DB), causing FK violations.
# Providing this empty fixture ensures the table is truncated during setup.
